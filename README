Very simple driver around Handbrake CLI, to make ripping TV show DVDs
easier.  Generally it should be obvious; however it has my preferred
layout hard-coded, so it may upset you in various unspecified ways. It
also has the Handbrake CLI path hardcoded, but that's not difficult to
fix.

It detects what are 'episodes' and what are (special) 'features'
heuristically, and seems to be right better than 90% of the time based
on an utterly non-representative sample of some Doctor Who DVDs I've
ripped. In fact, the other mode (for shows which I store in a
different filesystem layout) is completely untested at this point, as
are some of the more esoteric features like being able to rip both
disks of special releases without it blatting some or all of the files
from the first disk.

And finally, it doesn't invoke Handbrake CLI to do the ripping,
because on my Snow Leopard box at least the child process never exits,
so the entire system hangs. Instead, it's hardcoded to use 'weird'
mode, where pawl just outputs the commands you have to run (all nicely
separated by &&, so you can just cut and paste back into the
terminal).

It's entirely possible this is utterly useless to anyone other than me
;-)
