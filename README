Very simple driver around Handbrake CLI, to make ripping TV show DVDs
easier.  Generally it should be obvious; however it has my preferred
layout hard-coded, so it may upset you in various unspecified ways. It
attempts to find HandbrakeCLI in various sensible locations. Currently
it doesn't look under any other binary names, as I haven't bothered
finding out what it's called except on Mac OS.

It detects what are 'episodes' and what are (special) 'features'
heuristically, and seems to be right better than 90% of the time based
on the utterly non-representative sample of DVDs I've ripped so far.

It's entirely possible this is utterly useless to anyone other than me
;-)
